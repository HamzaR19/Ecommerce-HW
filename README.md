## Description

I created a complete back-end system for an E-Commerce site using the starter code provided. I have used many npm packages to achieve this and it gave me great insight into routing for the back-end of a application.

## Installation

Clone Repo into VScode. After you can run ```npm install``` to install all the packages. You will need to create a personal ```.env``` file with you MYSQL Username, Password. You can then open MySQL and add the Schema.sql to create the database. After this you can  ```NPM run seed```to seed the data with dummy data. After you have completed all these steps you can open up a new terminal at the root of the directory and run ```npm run start``` to start the server. After this you open Insomnia and test the routes.
